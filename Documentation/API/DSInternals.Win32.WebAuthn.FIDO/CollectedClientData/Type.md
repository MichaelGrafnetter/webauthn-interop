This member contains the string "webauthn.create" when creating new credentials, and "webauthn.get" when getting an assertion from an existing credential.

```csharp
public string Type { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

The purpose of this member is to prevent certain types of signature confusion attacks (where an attacker substitutes one legitimate signature for another).
