# WebAuthnApi.CancelCurrentOperation method

Cancels the WebAuthn operation currently in progress.

```csharp
public void CancelCurrentOperation()
```

## Remarks

When this operation is invoked by the client in an authenticator session, it has the effect of terminating any AuthenticatorMakeCredential or AuthenticatorGetAssertion operation currently in progress in that authenticator session. The authenticator stops prompting for, or accepting, any user input related to authorizing the canceled operation. The client ignores any further responses from the authenticator for the canceled operation.
