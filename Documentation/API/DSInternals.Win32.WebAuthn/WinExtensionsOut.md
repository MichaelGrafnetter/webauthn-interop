| [HmacSecret](WinExtensionsOut/HmacSecret.md) { get; set; } | This extension is used by the platform to retrieve a symmetric secret from the authenticator when it needs to encrypt or decrypt data using that symmetric secret. This symmetric secret is scoped to a credential. The authenticator and the platform each only have the part of the complete secret to prevent offline attacks. This extension can be used to maintain different secrets on different machines. https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido2/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.1-rd-20191217.html#sctn-hmac-secret-extension |
