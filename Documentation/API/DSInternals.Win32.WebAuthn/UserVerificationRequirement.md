# UserVerificationRequirement enumeration

This enumeration describes the Relying Party's requirements regarding user verification for the create() operation. Eligible authenticators are filtered to only those capable of satisfying this requirement.

```csharp
public enum UserVerificationRequirement
```

## Values

| name | value | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Any | `0` |  |
| Required | `1` | This value indicates that the Relying Party requires user verification for the operation and will fail the operation if the response does not have the UV flag set. |
| Preferred | `2` | This value indicates that the Relying Party prefers user verification for the operation if possible, but will not fail the operation if the response does not have the UV flag set. |
| Discouraged | `3` | This value indicates that the Relying Party does not want user verification employed during the operation (e.g., in the interest of minimizing disruption to the user interaction flow). |
