## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [WinExtensionsIn](WinExtensionsIn/WinExtensionsIn.md)() | The default constructor. |
| [CredProtect](WinExtensionsIn/CredProtect.md) { get; set; } | This extension indicates that the authenticator supports enhanced protection mode for the credentials created on the authenticator. If present, verify that the credentialProtectionPolicy value is one of following values: userVerificationOptional, userVerificationOptionalWithCredentialIDList, userVerificationRequired https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido2/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.1-rd-20191217.html#sctn-credProtect-extension |
| [EnforceCredProtect](WinExtensionsIn/EnforceCredProtect.md) { get; set; } | Controls whether it is better to fail to create a credential rather than ignore the protection policy. When enforceCredentialProtectionPolicy is true, and credentialProtectionPolicy is either userVerificationOptionalWithCredentialIDList or userVerificationRequired, the platform SHOULD NOT create the credential in a way that does not implement the requested protection policy. https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido2/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.1-rd-20191217.html#sctn-credProtect-extension |
| [HmacSecret](WinExtensionsIn/HmacSecret.md) { get; set; } | This extension is used by the platform to retrieve a symmetric secret from the authenticator when it needs to encrypt or decrypt data using that symmetric secret. This symmetric secret is scoped to a credential. The authenticator and the platform each only have the part of the complete secret to prevent offline attacks. This extension can be used to maintain different secrets on different machines. https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido2/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.1-rd-20191217.html#sctn-hmac-secret-extension |
